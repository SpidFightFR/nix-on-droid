## What is that ?
That is a repo dedicated to my `nix-on-droid` configuration files. <br>
It contains everything you need to literally clone my `nix-on-droid` install. <br>

## Why ?
Because this git repo is a neat way for me to fetch the config. <br>
Since i'm hosting it on GitHub, better share the config with you all. <br>
Feel free to take it, fork the config, edit it the way you want <br>

## What does it contain
Well it contains basically the configs for a familiar Linux environment for me (non exhaustive-list):
- `fastfetch` (with the android distro, with the `ff` shortcut, since it's not recognized on `com.termux.nix`)
- `git` (used to push/pull this repo)
- `wget` / `curl` combo (I always keep those, they are very useful for me)
- `ffmpeg` / `yt-dlp` (useful multimedia tools)
- some pentest tools i regularily use (`hashcat` - although not really useful on my device ; `aircrack` - pointless without rooting your phone ; `crunch`)
- `bash` & tweaks (includes bash completion and my bashrc sample)
- `neovim` & tweaks (includes aliases to vi & vim, alongside my nvim config)

That's about it, take care !
